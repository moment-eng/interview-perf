# Bug

This repository contains a very simple app that reproduces a bug. Instructions on the reproduction
are displayed when you start the application. Our objective is to diagnose and fix the bug—or at
least get a good start on it!

You can use any tools you'd like for this task. `console.log`, debuggers, Google—any of that is fair
game.

Some things to keep in mind when debugging:

* The fix requires only a single line to change.
* This app is about 60LOC and has a single, vendored dependency, which itself has no other
  dependencies.
* It is **not** important that you definitively locate and resolve the issue. Please feel free to
  slow down and think methodically!

For reference, the directory structure looks like this:

```
/
    src/
        App.tsx      <- primary logic (about 60 LOC)
        vendor/      <- a vendored version of Mousetrap, our only app-level dependency
        [...]        <- "the rest" of the scaffolding generated by create-react-app
    public/          <- public images and the like
    [...]            <- more scaffolding, e.g., package.json
```

## Running the App

This is a simple `create-react-app`, and can be run in the usual way:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

## Getting Started

Once `npm start` is run, the development server will open the page. By default this will be at
`localhost:3000`.

Once the page is open, you should see clear instructions for how to reproduce the bug:
