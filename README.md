# A perf adventure

This repository contains a very simple app with clear performance targets which it ✨ fails to meet
✨. Our job is to:

-   _investigate_ possible performance issues,
-   _fix_ issues that are _straightforward_,
-   and _develop a plan_ for those that are not.

You can use any tools you'd like for this task. `console.log`, debuggers, Google—any of that is fair
game.

## What you can expect

-   It is **not** important that we definitively hit the performance target in the allocated time.
    In fact, it is **most likely that we do not**, and **that is ok.**
-   There are **many ways** to hit the performance target, or develop a plan that is likely to hit
    the performance target.
-   This app is about 60LOC and has a single, vendored dependency, which itself has no other
    dependencies.

## Source structure

For reference, the directory structure looks like this:

```
/
    src/
        App.tsx      <- primary logic (about 60 LOC)
        Bindings.tsx <- hooks for keybindings
        vendor/      <- a vendored dependency in a single file
        [...]        <- "the rest" of the scaffolding generated by create-react-app
    public/          <- public images and the like
    [...]            <- more scaffolding, e.g., package.json
```

## Running the App

This is a simple `create-react-app`, and can be run in the usual way:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

## Getting Started

Once `npm start` is run, the development server will open the page. By default this will be at
`localhost:3000`.

Once the page is open, you should see clear instructions for how to reproduce the bug.
